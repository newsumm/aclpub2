Abstract#==#A modular approach has the advantage of being compositional and controllable, comparing to most end-to-end models.
  In this paper we propose Extract-Select-Rewrite (ESR), a three-phase abstractive sentence summarization method.
  We decompose summarization into three stages:
  (i) knowledge extraction, where we extract relation triples from the text using off-the-shelf tools;
  (ii) content selection, where a subset of triples are selected;
  and (iii) rewriting, where the selected triple are realized into natural language.
  Our results demonstrates that ESR is competitive with the best end-to-end models while being more faithful. %than these baseline models.
  Being modular, ESR's modules can be trained on separate data which is beneficial in low-resource settings and enhancing the style controllability on text generation.
