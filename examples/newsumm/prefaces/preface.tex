The development of intelligent systems capable of producing concise, fluent, and accurate summaries is a longstanding objective in natural language processing. This workshop serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas towards achieving this aim. It brings together experts from various disciplines, including summarization, language generation, and cognitive and psycholinguistics, to discuss key issues in automatic summarization. The agenda covers a wide array of topics, such as innovative paradigms and frameworks, multilingual and cross-lingual setups, shared tasks, information integration, novel evaluation methods, applied research, and future research directions. The workshop is aimed at fostering a cohesive research community, expediting the transfer of knowledge, and developing new tools, datasets, and resources to meet the needs of academia, industry, and government.
