Abstract#==#Summarization of scientific articles often overlooks insights from citing papers, focusing solely on the document's content. To incorporate citation contexts, we develop a model to summarize a scientific document using the information in the source and citing documents. It concurrently generates abstractive and extractive summaries, each enhancing the other. The extractive summarizer utilizes a blend of heterogeneous graph-based neural networks and graph attention networks, while the abstractive summarizer employs an autoregressive decoder. These modules exchange control signals through the loss function, ensuring the creation of high-quality summaries in both styles.
