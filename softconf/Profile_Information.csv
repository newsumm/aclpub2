After completing a masters in Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon's Language Technologies Institute (LTI), I worked at Flatiron Health where I developed and deployed algorithms to extract clinical information from unstructured oncology data at scale. I introduced deep learning to the company and architected a generalized model that improves the status quo of information extraction from large-scale longitudinal clinical notes. I hosted the first deep learning hackathon as well.  I recently completed my first year as a PhD student at Columbia under advisor Noemie Elhadad. My research lies at the intersection of NLP, deep learning, and clinical data.","columbia.edu

His interests are in applied semantic processing, focusing on textual inference, natural semantic representations, open representation, consolidation and summarization of multi-text information, and interactive text summarization. Dagan and colleagues initiated textual entailment recognition (RTE, aka NLI) as a generic empirical task. He was the President of the ACL in 2010 and served on its Executive Committee during 2008-2011. In that capacity, he led the establishment of the journal Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, which became one of two premiere journals in NLP. Dagan received his B.A. summa cum laude and his Ph.D. (1992) in Computer Science from the Technion. He was a research fellow at the IBM Haifa Scientific Center (1991) and a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories (1992-1994). During 1998-2003 he was co-founder and CTO of FocusEngine and VP of Technology of LingoMotors. He is currently heading the Bar-Ilan University Data Science Institute.","cs.biu.ac.il

"diego.molla-aliod","diego.molla-aliod@mq.edu.au","Diego","Molla","Macquarie University","AU","Australia","My research contribution focuses topics related to automated text-based question answering and summarisation. Since 2009 I have focused on medical text processing.

I joined the University of Zurich and became the principal researcher in the ExtrAns and WebExtrAns projects (from 1996 to 2001). Both projects were based on the development of answer extraction systems. Answer extraction systems locate those sentences in the source text that contain the answer posed by the user. The outcome of the project was a working system that handles questions about 500 Linux/Unix documentation documents (""manpages""). I was the principal designer of the overall system and the integration of all modules. I was also the principal contributor to the design of the logical forms and the question-answering method that used the logical forms. The success of ExtrAns and WebExtrAns is evident from the fact that the system is cited as a pioneering question-answering system, an example of a question answering system of technical domains, and an example of the use of logical forms for question answering.

In Macquarie University I established the AnswerFinder project. AnswerFinder is a question answering system that combines the use of logical information (inspired from ExtrAns and WebExtrAns), state-of-the-art approaches in question answering, and innovative graph-based machine learning methods to find the exact answer to the user question. AnswerFinder has participated in the question answering track of the Text REtrieval conference (TREC), the main international forum for the evaluation of question-answering systems, between 2003 and 2006. AnswerFinder is in fact the only Australian-based question answering system that has participated in the question answering track of TREC.

Since 2009 I have led various projects related to the development and application of text-processing technologies that help the medical doctor find and appraise clinical evidence found in the vast resources of medical publications. I have gathered a summarisation corpus sourced from the Journal of Family Practice, and used the corpus to develop and evaluate techniques for text summarisation, clustering, keyword exraction, and appraisal of the medical evidence. I have participated in the BioASQ challenge since 2017.","mq.edu.au","Yes","https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Diego-Molla-Aliod/6969828","https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=FZhJRQUAAAAJ&hl=en","https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4973-0963","https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Mark-Johnson/145177220

I am recipient of Best Paper Award for IEEE Conference paper. I am author of two books published by Springer. I have also written book chapters in books like Big data analytics by PHI Publication and Semigraph and their applications by the academy of discrete mathematics and applications and CRC book, India. I am a reviewer of conferences and journals like MDPI, Elsevier, Interscience. 
I have focussed in the last few years on the research issued in machine learning, handling big unstructured data and graph models for representing and analyzing text documents. 
I am guiding undergraduate students and postgraduate students in the area of information retrieval, machine learning, Natural Language processing and graph theory.
Currently I am working with Pune Institute of Computer Technology from last 20 years.","sssonawane@pict.edu","Yes","39786233","https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sJLqr_4AAAAJ&hl=en","0000-0002-8733-8340","2655256
